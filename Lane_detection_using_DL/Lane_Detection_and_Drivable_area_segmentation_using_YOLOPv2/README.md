## YOLOPv2
YOLOPv2 is an excellent multi-task network based on YOLOP. By using YOLOPv2 we tried **multiple lane detection** and **drivable area segmentation** and **object detection**(although **object detection** is not part of our project). Constraint of computational power and deployment of model on edge devices was kept in mind. This model can reach real-time on embedded device Jetson TX2 with TensorRT deployment.
